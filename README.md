# VBA-Challenge
## Stock Market Data Analysis
### Created a VBA script that loops through all of the stock data for one year and outputs the following:
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- Highlights positive & negative changes.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- The stock with the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest total Volume.

### Additionally, the script runs on every worksheet by running the script just once.
